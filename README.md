Winterweather
v1
======================

Loving the dark and cold seasons and thus Betty's Winter and Autumn Overhauls very much, I made some modifications to Oblivion's vanilla weather to use with them. It just makes it more likely to be overcast and to snow, in regions around Leyawiin and Anvil it's rainier and thunderstorms are more frequent. Nights are slightly longer as well. 

This is not intended to be used with any other mods that modify the weather and climate zones ( e. g. All natural)!


Installation

Extract the esp file to your Oblivion/Data folder and activate with OBMM / Wrye Bash / ...
